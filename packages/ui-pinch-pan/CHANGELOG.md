# @kuboon/remix-ui-pinch-pan

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- `pinchPan()` — a `@remix-run/ui` mixin for two-finger pinch and pan on touch and pen input. The
  host listens, its content is transformed, and the content point under the fingers' centroid stays
  under their centroid.
- The scale is clamped before the translation is solved, so reaching `minScale` / `maxScale` stops
  the zoom without sliding the content out from under the fingers.
- Adding or lifting a finger re-anchors against the transform the content already has, so the view
  does not jump mid-gesture.
- `controls` hands the rest of the component `set()` / `reset()` and the current transform.
- `anchorGesture()` / `advanceGesture()` are exported on their own for components that paint the
  view themselves.
